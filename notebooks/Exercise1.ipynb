    "Subjet b tagging is in many respects similar to the b tagging of the \"standard\" ak4 jets. However, there are some important differences to consider. Since subjets can get close to one another, using a fixed-size track association cone could lead to double-counting of tracks if they are associated to more than one subjet. To avoid such track sharing, the explicit jet-track association is used for subjets where tracks linked to the charged PF jet constituents are associated to the subjet. Similarly, a fixed-size association cone can lead to ambiguities in the secondary vertex and jet flavor assignment for subjets. This problem is resolved by ghost-associating secondary vertices and generator level hadrons/partons to subjets (see [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideBTagMCTools) for more details). An important thing to keep in mind is that the ghost association, in addition to the subjet collection of, also requires collections of original and groomed fat jets to be present since the \"ghost\" constituents are first associated to fat jets and then to subjets of the groomed fat jets.\n",
    "\n",
