The format has to be given in a python tuple of type: ('AK4Calo',['L2Relative', 'L3Absolute'], patMet).

If so a new patMet collection will be added to your PAT         Tuple in addition to the raw patMet. This new patMet collection will have the MET(Type1/2) corrections applied. The argument can have the following types: 'type-1' for         type-1 corrected MET; 'type-2' for type-1 plus type-2 corrected MET; '' or 'none' if no further MET corrections should be applied to your MET.
